            <div class="content">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Eero Saarinen (1910–1961) was a Finnish-American architect and furniture designer. He emigrated to the U.S. from Finland in 1923, where he grew up in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Saarinen studied sculpture in Paris and architecture at Yale, graduating in 1934. After traveling in Europe and North Africa, he returned to the U.S. and worked in his father Eliel Saarinen's architectural practice.</p>
                    <p>In 1940, Saarinen collaborated with Charles Eames to design furniture using molded plywood, winning a competition hosted by the Museum of Modern Art. Saarinen went on to create iconic furniture for Knoll International and became a U.S. citizen that same year. During World War II, he worked for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), producing designs for the White House and bomb manuals.</p>
                    <p>After his father's death, Saarinen founded his own firm, Eero Saarinen and Associates. He was known for his bold, sculptural designs, merging modernism and expressionism. His most famous work is the TWA Terminal at JFK Airport in New York. Saarinen died of a brain tumor in 1961 while working on Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>The TWA Flight Center at JFK Airport is a striking example of mid-20th-century modernist architecture, designed by architect Eero Saarinen and opened in 1962 for Trans World Airlines. Its unique, futuristic design with sweeping curves made it a symbol of the Jet Age. After TWA ceased operations in 2001, the terminal was closed but was reopened in 2019 as the TWA Hotel. The hotel preserves the building’s original 1960s aesthetic while offering modern amenities, including a rooftop pool and retro-themed restaurants. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a New York City Landmark, celebrated for its architectural significance and role in air travel history.</p>

                    <p>The TWA Flight Center’s head house is a two-story structure with a distinctive thin-shell concrete roof. The roof consists of four shells: two upward-slanting wings and two downward-slanting shells at the front and back. The shells converge at the center and are supported by four Y-shaped piers, each 51 feet tall. Skylights are placed between the shells, and the roof’s thickness varies from 7 to 40 inches. The roof weighs 6,000 tons and is reinforced with steel to support its cantilevered design.</p>
                    <p>The facade features large green-tinted glass walls, with single-story wings extending north and south for maintenance purposes. Inside, the terminal includes an intermediate level accessible by staircases, with walls and floors lined with ceramic tiles. It is equipped with modern technology, including a public address system, CCTV, baggage carousels, and split-flap display boards.</p>
