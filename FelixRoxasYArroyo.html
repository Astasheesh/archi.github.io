                    <p>He was the first Filipino architect, and a prominent member of the Roxas family. He designed the Jesuit Church of San Ignacio when it was rebuilt in 1863 on Arzobispado Street in Intramuros. He was trained in Europe in 1884 and spent his early career in England and India. When he returned to the Philippines, he developed an affection for Revivalist architecture. For the San Ignacio Church he imagined a new neoclassical building more in temper to the legacy of the Jesuits. Roxas commissioned the director of the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura, Agustin Saez to design the altars and pulpits. For the pulpit, ceiling and artesonado, he commissioned Isabelo Tampingco, the master sculptor. The church was begun in 1878 but was complete only in 1889, after his death. The church was destroyed during the battle of Manila in February 1945. Another church that he designed was the neo gothic Santo Domingo Church in Intramuros which he completed in 1875. The church was also destroyed in the Battle of Manila in February 1945. Many of the plans for these buildings survived because he asked his brother Felix draft the facades and interiors of most of his buildings.</p>

                    <p>The Santo Domingo church is also called as the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of La Naval de Manila. First built in 1588, and as destroyed and renovated, currently located at Quezon City, which is the sixth church. The fifth church was made by Architect Felix Roxas, with the help of Isabelo Tampinco, imitating the English gothic design.</p>
                    <p>Housed in this church was the ivory image of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary (Nuestra Senora del Santissimo Rosario). Carved in 1593 as a gift of Gov. Gen. Luis Dasmarinas. Also known as Virgin of La Naval in honor of her divine intervention in the Spanish victory against the Dutch navy. Saved from World War II, the statue was re-enshrined in 1954 at the blessing of the sixth church in Quezon City.</p>
