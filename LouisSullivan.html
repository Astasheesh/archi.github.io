                <div class="text">
                    <p>Louis Sullivan (1856-1924) was a pioneering American architect known as the “father of skyscrapers” and a major figure in modern architecture. He was a key Chicago school member and mentored Frank Lloyd Wright. Along with Wright and Henry Richardson, Sullivan is considered one of the most influential architects of his time. The famous design principle “form follows function” is often attributed to him, although the concept dates back to the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius. Sullivan was awarded the AIA Gold Medal posthumously in 1944, making him the second architect to receive this prestigious award.

            <h2>Famous Work: Prudential (Guaranty) Building</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="text">
                    <p>The Guaranty Building, previously known as the Prudential Building, is an early skyscraper located in Buffalo, New York. Designed by Louis Sullivan, often referred to as the Father of Skyscrapers, along with Dankmar Adler, the building was completed in 1896. Sullivan's design philosophy emphasized that "form follows function," and he and Adler organized the building into four distinct zones. The basement served as the mechanical and utility area, while the ground floor was dedicated to public spaces, including shops, entrances, and lobbies. The third zone comprised the office floors, featuring uniform office spaces arranged around central elevator shafts. The final zone housed elevator equipment, utilities, and a few offices. One of the most notable features of the Guaranty Building is its ornamentation. The building's striking terra cotta exterior is embellished with beautiful, intricate details. Sullivan aimed to link the structure to nature, incorporating decorative elements inspired by tree branches at the top, along with flowers, seed pods, and twisting green ironwork adorning the lower sections of the building.</p>
