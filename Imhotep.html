                    <p>Imhotep was a high official in the court of Pharaoh Djoser. He is an Egyptian polymath involved in various fields of profession such as a public official, priest, architect, scholar and physician. Despite being a commoner, Imhotep was able to ascend to a chief architect for Pharaoh Djoser of the Third Dynasty of Egypt, making him the first architect among other distinctions. Imhotep is known for the establishment of the first ever pyramid known as the Step Pyramid at Saqqara.</p>

                    <p>The step pyramid is the oldest important stone sturcture in Egypt. This pyramid was designed for Djoser, the first king of the 3rd dynasty. It has six-tier “step” layers rising to a height of about 200 ft (61m). The whole site has been described as a “vast city of the dead.”</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Mastabas:</strong> These structures were originally square and made of stone, with cores of irregular blocks filled with local clay (tafla) and dressed in sloping Tura limestone. The burial chamber was a straightforward oblong room made of pink granite slabs, surrounded by broken fragments used as packing materials.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Pyramids:</strong> Imhotep initially designed a four-stage pyramid using a mastaba as the base, which was later expanded into a six-stage structure. Its core was built from small limestone blocks quarried on-site and enclosed with fine, white Tura limestone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Galleries:</strong> The western walls of the peripheral galleries featured panels of inlaid faience tiles, designed to mimic reed matting. These tiles were secured with tenons inserted into carefully crafted mortices within precisely designed channels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enclosure Wall:</strong> The complex was encircled by a massive wall of fine white limestone blocks, crafted to replicate the mud-brick walls of the royal palace, known as the "White Walls," featuring a niche-and-buttress facade.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Entrance Passage:</strong> A corridor that features two rows of 20 fluted columns resembling reed bundles, with a ceiling carved to mimic wooden logs. The nearly 6-meter-high columns, made of drum segments, were linked to the corridor walls by short partitions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Great Court (South Court):</strong> Within the open courtyard are a pair of large stones shaped like a double-horseshoe.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Token Palace:</strong> The surface was adorned with a facade that mimicked reed matting, with a frieze of cobras with their hoods flared, poised to strike along the top.</li>
                        <li><strong>The South Tomb:</strong> This tomb, located at the southern end of the Great Court, has a low, vaulted roof and a cobra frieze. Its burial chamber, made of pink granite, lies at the bottom of a vertical shaft, with traces of an earlier limestone version featuring star-carved ceilings. The limestone interior walls include a palm log-style ceiling, replicating key Step Pyramid features like a descending corridor, granite-vaulted shaft, blue-tiled palace, and ritual relief panels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Heb-Sed Court:</strong> Features dummy chapels made of solid masonry lining its long sides. Each chapel had a small court divided into two sections by a screen wall, creating a bent-axis approach. The forecourt was accessed through permanently open stone doors with carved hinges and pivots, while the inner courtyard walls showcased carved wooden fence designs.</li>
                        <li><strong>West Side (Heb-Sed Court):</strong> It features 13 chapels in two styles. The first had three with flat roofs, torus moldings, cavetto cornices, and reed-inspired designs (sah netjer/Hall of the God). While the 2nd style had ten with low vaulted roofs, wood-framed structures, supported by fluted columns with pendant leaf capitals (per wer/Great House). Each chapel’s facade has a doorway leading to a room with palm log-style carved ceilings.</li>
                        <li><strong>East side (Heb-Sed Court):</strong> There are twelve shrines with vaulted roofs but have no columns. They possess a distinctive fan-shaped cornice. The prototype was most likely made of mud brick, wooden poles and reed matting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Temple T:</strong> The first room is a hypostyle hall (albeit one with only two columns). The columns were of papyrus bundles and were attached to the side wall. The focal point of the west of the building was a square room with a niche in the north wall. The niche was flanked by pilasters and towered over by a frieze of djed symbols.</li>
